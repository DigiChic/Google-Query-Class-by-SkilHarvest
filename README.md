# Project overview
This data looks at Google Query which was the first module treated at the SkilHarvest Data Analysis class.

What is Google Query? 

Google Query is like a magical treasure chest for numbers and words.

**What does it do?**
- It helps you find answers to tricky questions about data.
- You tell it what you want, and it digs through piles of information to find just the right stuff.
- It's like having a super-smart detective friend who knows where to look!
- Google Query is like a secret code that unlocks hidden knowledge.
